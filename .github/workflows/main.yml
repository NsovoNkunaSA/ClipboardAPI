    # Job name shown in GitHub Actions UI
    name: Run Jest Tests and Upload to Codecov
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the code from your GitHub repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20  # Specify Node.js version

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies using npm
      # Using `npm install` because `npm ci` requires a package-lock.json
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4 (optional): Set executable permission on Jest binary
      # Only needed if Jest is not executable by default in your project
      - name: Set permissions for Jest
        run: chmod +x node_modules/.bin/jest

      # Step 5: Run your Jest tests and generate a coverage report
      # The coverage report will be saved to ./coverage/lcov.info
      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: npm run test -- --coverage

      # Step 6: Upload the coverage report to Codecov
      # The token is only required if your repo is private
      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
        with:
          files: ./coverage/lcov.info  # Path to the coverage report file
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}  # Secret set in GitHub for private repos
